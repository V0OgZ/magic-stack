## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues with Multiplayer Tests

### Multiplayer Demo (`multiplayer-demo.spec.ts`)
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILING
- **Problems**:
  1. **Session Discovery**: Player 2 cannot see the session created by Player 1
  2. **Polling Sync**: 5-second polling may not be fast enough for tests
  3. **Backend State**: Sessions might not be persisting correctly
  4. **Window Positioning**: Cannot control browser window positions in Playwright

### Root Causes
1. **Direct Navigation**: Going to `/multiplayer` directly might bypass session initialization
2. **Timing Issues**: Session creation and polling are not synchronized
3. **Backend Integration**: The test assumes backend multiplayer is fully functional

## üéØ Recommendations

1. **Simplify Multiplayer Test**: Just verify UI loads correctly without full session flow
2. **Mock Backend**: Use mocked responses for predictable behavior
3. **Single Window Test**: Test multiplayer UI in single window first
4. **Focus on UI**: Test that buttons, forms, and navigation work rather than full multiplayer flow
