# Heroes of Time - Game Workflow

## üéÆ How to Play a Complete Turn

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the game
./start-app.sh

# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend:  http://localhost:8080
```

### üîÑ Complete Turn Workflow

#### **1. View Game State**
- Check your current resources (Gold: ~21,100)
- View your heroes and their positions
- See available buildings and construction progress
- Plan your actions for the turn

**API Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/games/demo-game
```

#### **2. Move Heroes**
- Select a hero (e.g., "Arthur" at position 2,2)
- Click target position on map
- System calculates movement cost with ZFC (Zone of Temporal Causality)
- Hero moves with proper pathfinding

**Example Move:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/heroes/hero-1/move \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"targetPosition": {"x": 5, "y": 5}}'
```

**Result:** Hero moves with ZFC cost calculation (e.g., 2.0 movement points)

#### **3. Construct Buildings**
- Open Castle Management interface
- Choose building type (barracks, archery_range, magic_guild, etc.)
- Verify resource costs
- Place building at chosen position

**Example Construction:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/games/demo-game/buildings/construct \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "playerId": "player1",
    "castleId": "castle_player1", 
    "buildingType": "magic_guild",
    "positionX": 9,
    "positionY": 9
  }'
```

**Result:** Building enters construction queue with completion timer

#### **4. Manage Resources**
- Check current resources: Gold, Wood, Stone, Ore, etc.
- Buildings provide daily bonuses (Gold: +6,300, Defense: +16)
- Plan future constructions based on available resources

#### **5. End Turn**
- Click "End Turn" button
- Backend processes all pending actions
- Buildings complete if construction time elapsed
- Daily resource bonuses applied
- Turn advances to next player

**End Turn:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/games/demo-game/end-turn
```

**Result:** `{"success":true,"message":"Turn ended successfully"}`
