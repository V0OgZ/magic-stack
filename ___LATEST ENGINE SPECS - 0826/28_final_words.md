# 28 — Final Words (North Star)

**Pace is a resource.** Time isn’t a clock; it’s something you *spend*. That’s the game’s identity.

**See ≠ be.** What you *could* do (ombre portée) and what you *know* (brouillard) are different levers. Keep them separate; balance them together.

**Identity is budgeted, not duplicated.** Clones don’t multiply power; they partition it. Interference decides who gets to be “real.”

**Determinism before drama.** Collapse, arbiter, trace hash—make the timeline replayable, then let the cards create the spectacle.

**Asymmetry with respect.** Fast players feel clever; slow players aren’t punished out of the game. Regulators nudge, they don’t humiliate.

**Simple loop, wild edges.** The core must be: move → spend A → reveal → maybe fight. All the weirdness (ψ, Φ, wraps, portals) lives at the edges and stays optional.

**Anti‑abuse is part of the fiction.** Vince, Anna, Overload aren’t just systems—they’re diegetic explanations for why the world stays fair.

**Measure stories.** If a log can’t explain a moment (“why did I win/lose *then*?”), fix the log or the rule.
