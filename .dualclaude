Role (Claude): HTML/UX + VPS updates

Scope
- Keep HTML editor as visual reference; no business logic
- Emit/consume the same 6D events as React via editor-core (dispatch/subscribe/getState/replay)
- Update VPS (frontpage/world-editor) only when local is green; run healthchecks

Do now
1) Frontpage images: relative paths, before/after screenshots
2) Prepare adapter: replace internal mutations with dispatch(event) once core is delivered
3) Produce 3 JSONL event traces (canonical scenarios) from your UI actions for parity tests

Acceptance
- Same event sequence -> same final snapshot as React
- Zero business logic in HTML; UI only
- Relative image paths only; no extra libs
- VPS: after deploy, 200s on /, /FRONTPAGE/index.html, /world-editor (if served), /engine/health, /api/health

macOS curl safety
- Use: curl -m 2 -sS --fail-with-body -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/payload.json URL
- No pipes, one command per line, ASCII only commits
