# üìù Note from the Scribe - Script Management

Hi Donna! üíº

As our new COO, I thought you should know about our script organization system.

**New Tool Alert:**
- We now have a **SPELL CONTROL CENTER** (`/SPELL_CONTROL_CENTER.sh`)
- It's a central menu for managing all scripts/spells in the forest
- Think of it as a "script inventory management system"

**Why this matters to you:**
- Better organization = better efficiency
- Can track which services are running
- Easy restart/stop for all systems
- No more random scripts scattered everywhere

**Features you might like:**
- Status dashboard (Option 4)
- Service management (Options 5 & 6)
- Documentation auto-generation (Option 7)
- Clean, color-coded interface

I know you appreciate good organization, so this should help keep things professional!

*PS: We call scripts "spells" here, but it's basically the same thing* üòä

Best,
The Scribe
