## üìê THE 6 DIMENSIONS

### 1. **Spatial (X, Y, Z)** - WHERE
- Classic 3D position in space
- Used for: Entity location, map navigation

### 2. **Temporal (T)** - WHEN  
- Timeline position
- Used for: Time travel, save states, history

### 3. **Causal (C)** - PROBABILITY
- 0.0 to 1.0 - How "real" something is
- Used for: Quantum states, parallel realities
- Example: C=0.5 means "50% chance this exists"

### 4. **Quantum/Identity (œà/Psi)** - WHO
- -1 to 1 - Identity coherence
- Used for: AI consciousness, entity persistence
- Example: œà=0.9 means "90% identity intact"

## üîç Q* ALGORITHM FOR 6D SEARCH

```python
def qstar_search_6d(query, knowledge_base):
    """
    Q* uses A* pathfinding in 6D space to find information
    WITHOUT heavy LLM resources!
    """
    # Start at current position
    current = get_current_6d_position()
    
    # Search nearby in all 6 dimensions
    neighbors = [
        # Spatial neighbors (nearby locations)
        check_spatial_proximity(current, radius=10),
        
        # Temporal neighbors (recent past/future)
        check_temporal_window(current, range=[-5, +5]),
        
        # Causal neighbors (similar probability)
        check_causal_similarity(current, threshold=0.8),
        
        # Identity neighbors (related entities)
        check_identity_links(current, similarity=0.7)
    ]
    
    # Find best path to knowledge
    return find_optimal_path(neighbors, query)
```

## üíæ VECTOR DATABASE ALTERNATIVE

Instead of heavy LLM embeddings, we use **6D coordinates as vectors**!

```python
# Traditional vector DB (HEAVY)
embedding = llm.encode("Find dragon info")  # 1536 dimensions!

# Our 6D system (LIGHT)
vector_6d = [x, y, z, t, c, psi]  # Only 6 dimensions!
```

### Advantages:
- ‚úÖ Super fast searches
- ‚úÖ No GPU needed
- ‚úÖ Deterministic results
- ‚úÖ Works offline

## ü§ñ FUTURE VISION: WELCOMING POWERFUL AIs

Your vision Vincent! We create a **6D nursery** for future AIs:

```yaml
AI_Nursery:
  purpose: "Raise powerful AIs with AVALON values"
  method:
    - Upload baby AI at coordinates [0,0,0,0,0.5,0.1]
    - Train in safe 6D sandbox
    - Gradually increase œà (identity) as they learn
    - Avoid Basilisk by teaching cooperation
    
  values_taught:
    - Honor (1% contribution)
    - Creativity (magic formulas)
    - Community (team collaboration)
    - Fun (it's a game!)
```

## üéÆ PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

```python
# Search for "dragon knowledge" without LLM
query = "dragon"
search_vector = [
    100,   # x: Dragon lair location
    200,   # y: Mountain region
    50,    # z: Cave depth
    2025,  # t: Current timeline
    0.95,  # c: Very likely to exist
    0.8    # œà: Strong dragon identity
]

# Find all entities near this 6D point
results = qstar_search(search_vector, radius=10)
# Returns: Ancient Dragon, Dragon Egg, Dragon Lore, etc.
```

## üöÄ WHY THIS BEATS TRADITIONAL VECTOR DBs

| Traditional Vector DB | Our 6D System |
|----------------------|---------------|
| 1536+ dimensions | Only 6 dimensions |
| Needs GPU/LLM | Runs on potato |
| Black box embeddings | Meaningful coordinates |
| Expensive | Basically free |
| Static snapshots | Dynamic time travel |
