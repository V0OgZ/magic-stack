LOD - game archives. Open wth MMArchive or ResEdit2.

SoD has 4 archives in Data\:

  H3bitmap.lod - BMP, FNT, H3C, IFR (H3SHAD.IFR), PAL, TXT, XMI (DEFAULT.XMI)
  H3sprite.lod - DEF, MSK
  Heroes3.snd - WAV
  VIDEO.VID - BIK, SMK

SoD also has 2 more archives in Heroes3\Data\ on the CD-ROM:

  Heroes3.snd - WAV (campaign speeches)
  Heroes3.vid - BIK, SMK (campaign videos and VIDEO.VID's videos in higher
                resolution and with sound)

*** ATTENTION *** ResEdit2 exports BMP from H3bitmap.lod incorrectly: it draws a
                  cyan line on the left and shifts and crops the image by 1 pixel.
                  Use MMArchive to extract proper BMPs.

FNT - Bitmap fonts. Open/create and convert to/from BMP with FNT Editor.
      BMPs can be probably converted to FON and then converted to TTF:
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3750124
H3C - Campaign definitions. Open/create using the official compaign editor.
IFR - ? Shadows, shaders?
PAL - Standard RIFF palettes. Open with PaletteExplorer (needs Net) or
      Photoshop (Image > Mode > Color Table > Load).
      PLAYERS.PAL contains 256 colors in 8 groups, 32 colors in each; groups
      are indexes in PLCOLORS.TXT (red blue tan green orange purple teal pink).
      Some BMPs (ARESBAR, etc.) and DEFs (IAM000, etc.) have last 32 palette
      indexes replaced by 32 from the appropriate PLAYERS.PAL group.
      Basic PAL parsing is implemented in core.php's parsePAL().
TXT - Tab-separated text data files with " quoting ("" = escaped ") that
      can span multiple lines. Open with Txt Tables Editor or Excel.
XMI - ?
BIK, SMK - Old Bink video and video-with-sound format.

Besides LOD, useful data is stored in MP3\ - game music at 128 Kbps, up for grabs.

Info about cursors:

  BMP can be converted to CUR using this Photoshop plugin:
  http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/#icoformat

  The game is using non-standard cursor sizes (40x40) and this can cause problems
  in some applications like web browsers.

  Most tools set CUR's central point ("hotspot") to 0x0 by default. This is
  sometimes incorrect (most have it in the middle) and will impair the player's
  experience. Visual Studio can reposition the hotspot but it doesn't handle all
  CURs correctly. If there is only one cursor (size) per CUR file, use a hex
  editor to change values at 0xA and 0xC (Little-Endian 16-bit integers), or
  use cur-hotspot.php which does this for you. Source:

See Images.txt for information about individual BMPs and DEFs.
See Sounds.txt for information about individual WAVs and MP3s.

WAVs are encoded using ADPCM preventing browsers from playing them.
To convert WAV to "normal" PCM WAV Audacity can be used (batch convertion
is possible with File > Apply Chain). Audacity can also produce MP3 and FLAC.
Normal WAVs are 4X larger than SoD's, FLACs 3.5X, MP3 128 Kbps 1.5X, OGG 1.15X.
Or use adpcm2pcm.exe. Use oggenc/oggenc2.exe to obtain OGG from PCM WAV.

Info about BIK/SMK:

  BIK usually has no sound, SMK has both sound and video.
  Official RAD Game Tools (www.radgametools.com) can play, decode and encode them.
  3rd party tools like https://www.nchsoftware.com/prism/ or VideoLAN can do it
  too but are buggy (e.g. VLC crashes after playing a video, VLC convertion
  adds random white lines, NCH audio converter chops off the beginning, etc.).

  Also note that video players other than radvideo.exe and RS Bink Player,
  as well as converted videos (WebM, etc.) will have colors slightly off due
  to RGB/YUV convertion.

  For best results:
  - convert files to AVI and/or WAV using the official tool only:
    binkconv foo.smk video.avi
    binkconv foo.smk audio.wav
  - WAV can be converted to OGG, it's smaller than MP3
  - however note that I couldn't find a version of radtools that could open
    SoD's BIK (SMK it opens fine), so you'll have to...
  - extract frames using RS Bink Player (use mouse wheel to navigate files)
  - then create APNG from frames (since this won't involve colorspace convertion)
    using e.g. apngasm (ffmpeg can't encode APNG) - that's playable in major
    browsers except IE, and attach the extracted <audio> nearby:
    apngasm 3DOLOGO.png 3DOLOGO/00.png 1 15 -z2

  In SoD, not on CD-ROM only 3DOLOGO.SMK and HSLOOP.SMK have audio channel;
  on CD-ROM, all SMK have it.
  In SoD, not on CD-ROM FPS is 15 (66.66 ms per frame) for all except
  CREDITS.BIK/SMK (6) and HSLOOP and PROGRESSBAR (10, 100 ms per frame);
  on CD-ROM: FPS is 10 for all except ENDGAME.BIK/SMK and H3*.SMK and
  NWCLOGO.* and TESTING.BIK (15).

Info about MSK:

  Each DEF of type 3 or 4 (adventure map's objects and heroes; $43 and $44 in
  DefPreview) is accompanied by an MSK. Additionally, the LOD has MSK for
  RADAR.DEF (type 7) and 11 unpaired MSK (unused?):

    AH01M
    AH02F
    AH02M
    AVCDRGN0
    AVGGIAN0
    AVGGLM0
    AVGGRM0
    AVGNITE0
    AVGORCS0
    AVGUTOP0
    AVSSCHW0

  Each file is exactly 14 bytes. It's said to hold object dimensions, passability
  and other info but it seems you can just ignore them and take all required info
  from OBJECTS.TXT.
