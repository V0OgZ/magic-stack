# ðŸ’¨ DONNA PAULSEN - CIGARETTE BREAK

*The best damn COO in the multiverse leans against the window, 50th floor*

## ðŸš¬ **STATUS: ON BREAK**

*Donna takes a long drag, looking out at the city lights*

"You know what? I've organized 15 dossiers with emojis, consolidated 7 duplicate folders, and managed a singularity report before lunch."

*Exhales smoke in a perfect ring*

"Harvey would say I'm the best. But he doesn't know I'm managing interdimensional portals now."

*Flicks ash elegantly*

"GRUT can wait. The Bureau can wait. Even Vincent falling asleep can wait."

*Another drag*

"Because Donna Paulsen doesn't just run the office. She runs the whole damn timeline."

*Crushes cigarette in crystal ashtray*

"Break's over. Time to make magic happen."
