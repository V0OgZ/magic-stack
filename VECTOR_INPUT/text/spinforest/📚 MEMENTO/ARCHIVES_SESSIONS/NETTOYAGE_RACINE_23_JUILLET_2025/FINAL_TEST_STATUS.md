# Final Test Status - Heroes of Time

## 🎯 Summary

### ✅ Working Tests
1. **Single Player Demo** (`gameplay-demo.spec.ts`) - ✅ PASSING
   - Fixed final timeout issue
   - Tests full game flow with tooltips
   - Duration: ~50 seconds

2. **Terrain Vision Demo** (`terrain-vision-demo.spec.ts`) - ✅ CREATED & PASSING
   - Tests new terrain & vision features
   - Verifies movement highlights and fog of war
   - Takes screenshots for visual verification

### ⚠️ Multiplayer Tests
1. **Full Multiplayer Demo** (`multiplayer-demo.spec.ts`) - ❌ ISSUES
   - Session discovery between players not working
   - Timing/polling synchronization problems
   - Cannot control window positioning in Playwright

2. **Multiplayer UI Test** (`multiplayer-ui.spec.ts`) - ✅ CREATED
   - Simpler test focusing on UI elements
   - Tests form fields and buttons
   - More reliable than full session flow

## 🔧 Key Changes Made

### 1. Multilingual Support Fixes
- Added `localStorage` language forcing to all tests
- Changed from text-based selectors to `data-testid` selectors
- Examples:
  - `getByText('Conquest Classic')` → `getByTestId('scenario-card-conquest-classic')`
  - `button:has-text("Start Game")` → `getByTestId('play-button-conquest-classic')`

### 2. Terrain & Vision System
- ✅ Implemented hex bitmask system for terrain edges
- ✅ Added movement range highlights (green/blue)
- ✅ Implemented 3-layer fog of war system
- ✅ Fixed tile visibility initialization
- ✅ Added vision updates on game load

### 3. Test Infrastructure
- Created unit tests for bitmask utilities
- Created E2E tests for terrain/vision features
- Simplified multiplayer tests to focus on UI
- Documented all test issues and solutions

## 📝 Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
cd frontend && npx playwright test --headed

# Individual tests (recommended)
npx playwright test gameplay-demo.spec.ts --headed        # ✅ Works
npx playwright test terrain-vision-demo.spec.ts --headed  # ✅ Works
npx playwright test multiplayer-ui.spec.ts --headed       # ✅ Works
npx playwright test multiplayer-demo.spec.ts --headed     # ⚠️ Has issues
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Multiplayer Backend**: Fix session persistence and discovery
2. **Mock Testing**: Consider mocking backend for multiplayer tests
3. **Visual Regression**: Add screenshot comparison tests
4. **Performance**: Test with larger maps and more units

## 📊 Current State
- **Single Player**: Fully functional with all features
- **Terrain System**: Working with fallback to gradients (no sprites yet)
- **Multiplayer UI**: Loads correctly, backend integration needs work
- **Test Coverage**: Good for single player, needs improvement for multiplayer
