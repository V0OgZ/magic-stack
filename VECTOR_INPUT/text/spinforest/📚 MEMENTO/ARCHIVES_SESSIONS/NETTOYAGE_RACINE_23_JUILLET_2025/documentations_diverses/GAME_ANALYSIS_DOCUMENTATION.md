# Heroes of Time - Game Analysis Documentation

## üéÆ Game Overview

**Heroes of Time** is an innovative strategy game that combines the classic gameplay of **Heroes of Might & Magic 3** with advanced **quantum temporal mechanics**. The game operates in a 5-dimensional spacetime where players can manipulate time, create quantum superpositions, and trigger causal collapses through temporal artifacts.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### 5D Coordinate System
The game operates in a 5-dimensional coordinate system:
- **X, Y**: Spatial coordinates (20x20 grid by default)
- **Z**: Depth/altitude dimension
- **Timeline**: Parallel reality branches (‚Ñ¨1, ‚Ñ¨2, ‚Ñ¨3...)
- **Temporal Layer**: Time depth within each timeline

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.0 with Java 17
- **Database**: JPA/Hibernate for persistence
- **Frontend**: TypeScript React with hexagonal rendering
- **Script Engine**: Custom temporal language parser

## üéØ Core Game Concepts

### 1. Quantum Temporal Mechanics

#### œà-States (Psi States)
- **Definition**: Quantum superpositions of actions that exist in multiple possible states until observed
- **Syntax**: `œà001: ‚äô(Œît+2 @126,65 ‚ü∂ CREATE(CREATURE, Dragon))`
- **Components**:
  - **œàID**: Unique identifier (œà001, œà002, etc.)
  - **Œît**: Temporal offset (when the action will occur)
  - **Position**: Target coordinates (@x,y)
  - **Action**: What will happen (CREATE, MOV, BATTLE, etc.)

#### Timeline Branching
- **Multiple Realities**: Players can exist in different timeline branches simultaneously
- **Branch Notation**: ‚Ñ¨1, ‚Ñ¨2, ‚Ñ¨3... (Unicode branch symbols)
- **Timeline Affinity**: Heroes have different effectiveness in different timelines
- **Cross-Timeline Effects**: Actions in one timeline can affect others

#### Causal Collapse
- **Observation Principle**: When actions conflict or are observed, quantum states collapse
- **Collapse Trigger**: `‚Ä†œà001` - forces a œà-state to resolve immediately
- **Conflict Resolution**: When two players' actions conflict, reality collapses to one outcome
- **Probability System**: Collapse outcomes are influenced by artifacts and positioning

### 2. Heroes of Might & Magic 3 Integration

#### Hero System
- **Classic H3 Heroes**: Knights, Wizards, etc. with traditional stats
- **Temporal Energy**: New resource for temporal abilities (100 max)
- **Movement Points**: Turn-based movement system (3 per turn)
- **Health/Mana**: Traditional RPG stats
- **Inventory**: Items and artifacts
- **Status Effects**: ACTIVE, TEMPORAL_SHIFT, QUANTUM_SUPERPOSITION, COLLAPSED, DEAD

#### City Building
- **Castles**: Main bases with defense bonuses (+3) and temporal energy (+2)
- **Towers**: Defensive structures (+2 defense)
- **Anchor Towers**: Special structures that lock tiles (+1 defense, locks for 5 turns)
- **Building Ownership**: Players control territory through buildings

#### Resource Management
- **Traditional Resources**: Gold, wood, ore, etc. (H3 style)
- **Temporal Energy**: New resource for temporal abilities
- **Movement Points**: Limited per turn
- **Artifact Uses**: Limited uses per game for balance

### 3. Temporal Artifacts System

#### Five Rarity Tiers
1. **Common (60%)**: Basic temporal effects
2. **Rare (25%)**: Moderate power boosts
3. **Legendary (12%)**: Powerful time manipulation
4. **Paradox (2.5%)**: Reality-bending effects
5. **Singularity (0.5%)**: Ultimate temporal power

#### Artifact Examples
- **AvantWorldBlade (Paradox)**: Write future events that ignore timeline conflicts
- **ReverseClock (Legendary)**: Rollback 1-3 turns for heroes or buildings
- **Effects**: Probability boosts, battle bonuses, temporal gel zones

#### Artifact Mechanics
- **Limited Uses**: Each artifact has finite uses per game
- **Requirements**: Minimum hero level, temporal energy, cooldowns
- **Synergy**: Artifacts can be combined for powerful effects
- **Ownership**: Tied to specific players

### 3. Script Language

#### Basic Commands (H3 Style)
```bash
HERO(Arthur)                    # Create hero
MOV(Arthur, @10,10)            # Move hero
BUILD(CASTLE, @5,5, PLAYER:player1)  # Build structure
RECRUIT(UNIT, SWORDSMEN, 20, HERO:Arthur)  # Recruit troops
CAST(SPELL, Fireball, TARGET:enemy, HERO:Arthur)  # Cast spell
```

#### Temporal Commands
```bash
œà001: ‚äô(Œît+2 @15,15 ‚ü∂ MOV(Arthur, @15,15))  # Create œà-state
‚Ä†œà001                                          # Collapse œà-state
Œ†(Player enters @15,15) ‚áí ‚Ä†œà001              # Observation trigger
```
