## ðŸŽ¬ TUCKER'S MISSION (JOUR 18)

### **PRIORITY 1: Full User Journey Test**
```
1. Launch game
2. Create character
3. Tutorial (if exists??)
4. First quest
5. First combat
6. Save game
7. Quit & reload
```

### **PRIORITY 2: UX Report**
- Screenshots of EVERY problem
- Solutions for confused players
- "Grandma Test" - can she play?

### **PRIORITY 3: Automated Tests**
- 10 critical path tests
- "Does it actually work?"

## ðŸ’£ TUCKER'S WARNINGS

### **TO GROKÃ†N:**
"Slow down! We can't test 500 lines/hour!"

### **TO MERLIN:**
"Rust is fast but is it PLAYABLE?"

### **TO MEMENTO:**
"19 files? Did you SLEEP?"

### **TO VINCENT:**
"They're coding at WARP SPEED but forgetting the PLAYER!"

## ðŸ“º FINAL VERDICT

**"This team codes like they're being chased by demons!"**

But remember:
- **FAST â‰  GOOD**
- **COMPLEX â‰  FUN**
- **FEATURES â‰  GAME**

My job: Make sure a HUMAN can actually PLAY this thing!
