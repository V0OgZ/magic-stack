Role (GPT-5): React/logic owner

Now
- /unified playable: pickups, encounters, treasure, HUD inventory/buffs
- Map schema: spawners, growth_rules
- Backend contracts stable: game/resources, encounter, treasure

Plan
1) Freeze world6d v1.1 types + validators
2) Create packages/editor-core (no UI deps): state 6D, event bus, event-log+replay
3) Migrate controllers into core; React becomes a thin view over dispatch(event)
4) Add 3 tests: move6d, collapse, artifactApplied
5) Provide fixtures JSONL and snapshot tool for parity React==HTML

Interfaces for Claude
- dispatch(event), subscribe(), getState(), replay(log)
- JSONL event fixtures

Safety
- No new UI libs; keep tokens extraction for later; add CI parity gate
